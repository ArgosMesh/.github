## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to ArgosMesh, an organization focusing on multi-robot collaborative perception. Named after the vigilant Argos from Greek mythology, we envision our solutions empowering robots with similar enhanced perception capabilities.

We specialize in developing advanced algorithms that enable networks of autonomous robots to attain high-level scene understanding collaboratively. Our work draws inspiration from swarm robotics, cooperative SLAM, distributed sensing, and machine learning.
